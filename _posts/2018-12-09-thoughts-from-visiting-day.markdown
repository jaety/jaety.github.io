# Dad Overanalyzes 2nd Grade Math

During visiting day at my daughter's second grade class, part of the kids starting activity
was to all stand in a circle. Then one child started by saying 0, the next 10, and they proceeded
counting by 10s until a child reached 100. Then that child would sit and the game would continue
with the next child restarting at 0. 

I started to wonder, is there a closed form solution for who the winner will be?
